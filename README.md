# Leaf-disease-detection
Most of the plants are infected by various fungal and bacterial diseases. 
Due to the exponential inclination of population, the climatic conditions also cause plant disease.
The major challenges of sustainable development is to reduce the usage of pesticides, cost to save the environment and to increase the quality.
Precise, accurate and early diagnosis may reduce the usage of pesticides
.It provides various methods used to study crop diseases/traits using image processing and data mining. 
In addition, the infected area and affected percentage is also measured. 
The Back-Propagation concept is used for weight adjustment of training database.

In this project, we have used some new age technology in an attempt to solve this problem. 
On the core we will have used deep learning and machine learning classification to detect the disease from the images of the leaves of the plant. 
With the help of image segmentation, the dataset of is trained using CNN model to make prediction.
